# Mac-Mode_Changer
Simple python code to change original Mac Address and enable Monitor Mode on your wireless adapter in Kali Linux.
- Change original MAC Address to stay anonymous. 
- Change Wifi Adapter to Monitor Mode for packet capture.
(Actions often performed before using tools in de Aircrack-ng suite, like Airodump-ng)

I don't like to specify the name of the interface and the new mac address everytime I start the program. That's why I wrote the code like this (interface is Wlan0 and the new mac is 00:11:22:33:44:55). You can change it to your liking. Run the file in kali linux with: python3 run.py (name of the file with .py extension). 

(This is not a serious code project, just testing GitHub functionality)
